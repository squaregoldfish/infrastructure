Getting started
===============
To get started, one needs:  
- Linux
- Git
- Docker
- docker-compose

To avoid cloning the whole `infrastructure` repository, one can use Git's sparse checkouts.
To automate sparse cloning you can use the `sparse.sh` script from the root of this repo.
Run the following from a newly created folder for your new repo:

`wget https://github.com/ICOS-Carbon-Portal/infrastructure/raw/master/sparse.sh`  
`chmod +x sparse.sh`
`./sparse.sh <subproject> [<branch>]` (default branch is `master`)

`subproject` above must be one of the first-level folders in this repo.


Useful commands
===============

To get a list of Docker container IDs together with their Linux process IDs (run as root):
`docker ps | awk '{print $1}' | tail -n +2 | xargs docker inspect -f '{{ .Config.Hostname }} {{ .State.Pid }}'`

To purge unused Docker images:
`docker rmi $(docker images --filter "dangling=true" -q --no-trunc)`

To get a list of top 10 processes by memory usage:
`ps aux --sort -rss | head -n 10`

To get process' command:
`ps -fp <pid>`

To see all parents and direct children of a process:
`pstree -p -s <pid>`

Working dir of a process by id:
`pwdx <pid>`
