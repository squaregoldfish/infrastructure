1. Check that the following directories exist (could be links):
   Input/	  contains emisisons, inital+boundary
   Output/RData/  contains Rdata files: particle locations, eventually footprints
   Output/Results/   contains run specific files like 'Timesname' file with station location and time
   
2. Prepare list of all available stations - needs to be done only once or if new stations are available
   write_sellist.r
   -> allstations.txt

3. Start STILT for station XXX
   ./start.stilt.sh XXX
   this shell script starts prepare_input.r
      prepare_input.r
        checks if station XXX is in allstations.txt and extracts lat, lon information from allstations.txt
	checks if RDatat file for station XXX actually exists in Output/
	prepares Timensname file
	specifies time peroide  <- needs to be adapted!!!
	starts run.stilt.sh  (if station exists)
      run.stilt.sh script starts the STILT run
